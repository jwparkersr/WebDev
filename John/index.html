		<h3>Purposely Up Close and Personal Essay</h3>
		<p>
		Personal Space is a wonderful thing, is it not?  Well if you do not agree, just wait until someone invades yours.  Personal Space is our unique acceptable distance while interacting with another person, but it also changes from person to person.  For example, it is considered a socially unaccepted behavior to stand very close with someone while holding a conversation with them, unless of course that person is a very close individual to you.  As part of a project, I wanted to mainly view the reactions of people, strangers to me, as I talked with them up close and personal on a subject that they are knowledgeable about, and comfortable with.  Three of the major keys to this project that I found were the locations for violating personal space, the reactions to my violation of their personal space, and my experience in violating their personal space.
		</p>
		<p>
		In the planning process of my project, I thought long and hard on how and where I wanted to perform a violation.  Therefore, after choosing to violate personal space, came the decision of where to carry out this heinous violation of social etiquette.  I needed to find somewhere that I wouldn’t be harmed, for instance, although it would be great topic to write about, getting punched in the face wasn’t first on my list of things to do.  I needed somewhere in which that would not happen, and what better place to violate a persons personal space than someone who, by law, could not do anything about it.  Cordova Mall, here I come!  This choice was perfect, not only would I not be punched in the face, but also these people would actually try to help me while I attempted to violate their personal space.

		After deciding the location of where to violate personal space, came the action of actually carrying it out and watching for reactions.  I did not want to miss the slightest detailed reaction in the conversations so I invited people to join me; my brother, sister-in-law, and good friend to all witness the events unfold.  After arriving at Cordova Mall we all headed off to meet the first un-expecting victim.  Arriving in the first store, we all began to mingle about, pretending to shop around until an employee asked if they could help me find anything, gotcha!  I quickly stepped up very close and personal to the employee, and began talking with him about the product I was looking at. I could immediately tell that he was not at all comfortable with the distance between he and myself, because he, almost on impulse, took a slight step back from me.  Not really the reaction I was personally looking for, but a reaction nonetheless. The second store we decided to perform this violation gave, what I believe was, the best reaction of them all.  As I walked into the store it wasn’t long before an employee approached me to ask if I needed help, gotcha again! I, again, quickly stepped up close and personal to her, but without missing a beat, she took a step back.  Thinking that it may have only been a coincidence, I quickly stepped up close to her again and continued talking with her about the products, but again, she stepped back. This action continued as we moved through the store and by the end of our conversation, she had put up a physical and immovable barrier by stepping around the backside of the sales counter. Talk about getting a reaction!

		Although all of the of the interactions throughout the day gave me a wide variety of expressions, it really took stepping out of my social norm to experience them.  For example, while holding the conversation with the first employee, violating his personal space, I could hardly think of what topic to talk about, I ended up just telling him what I was looking for in the product.  My knees were literally shaking, by the end of the conversation, due to the fear of the employee saying something about violating his space.  I feel the second violation didn’t leave me near as wobbly only because I actually had an interest in the product that the individual was showing me, but it also may have been a little because I was partially laughing by her actions of attempting to recover her personal space.

		Even though the social norm of personal space differs from person to person, it is a very coveted social norm by all regardless, and everyone has their limit on how close a stranger may get to them without feeling awkward. I should know, I’ve violated my own while attempting to violate other’s, and while I feel I chose an excellent place to violate a social norm, the outcome and reactions I received from those I choose to violate were ones that could not have anticipated.  I can say that I have had an experience with this project, but getting up close and personal was only a once and a lifetime ordeal for me, I hope.
